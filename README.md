# 📦 Bootstrap Practice Project
_A simple multi-section webpage build while learning Bootstrap fundamentals._
<h2>📚 About this project</h2>
This project was created as a part of my learning journey while taking Angela Yu's "Web Development Bootstrap" course on Udemy back in November 2024.
The goal was to understand and practice:
- Bootstrap grid system
- Navigation bars
- Cards & responsive design
- Utlity classes
- Layout structure
- Basic UI/UX styling
This is just a practice project, not a high-end website, but it demonstrated my understanding of core frontend concepts.
<h2>🚀 Features</h2>
- Responsive layout using Bootstrap's grid
- Navbar, hero section, cards and footer
- Clean and minimal design
- Pure HTML + CSS + Boostrap (no backend)
