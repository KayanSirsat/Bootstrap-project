# 📦 Bootstrap Practice Project
_A simple multi-section webpage build while learning Bootstrap fundamentals._
<h2>📚 About this project</h2>
This project was created as a part of my learning journey while taking Angela Yu's "Web Development Bootstrap" course on Udemy back in November 2024.
The goal was to understand and practice:
<br>- Bootstrap grid system
<br>- Navigation bars
<br>- Cards & responsive design
<br>- Utlity classes
<br>- Layout structure
<br>- Basic UI/UX styling
<br>This is just a practice project, not a high-end website, but it demonstrated my understanding of core frontend concepts.
<h2>🚀 Features</h2>
<br>- Responsive layout using Bootstrap's grid
<br>- Navbar, hero section, cards and footer
<br>- Clean and minimal design
<br>- Pure HTML + CSS + Boostrap (no backend)
